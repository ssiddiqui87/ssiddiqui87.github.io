    <div>
        I am currently a student at Wayne State University pursuing my degree in Computer Science. I am 3 classes away from finishing. Had I not been doing this bootcamp, I would have been finishing up my last semster.

        During my schooling at Wayne State University, I learned C++ and Java. Having knowledge of those two langauges has greatly helped me in learning C# at Grand Circus.

        I live in Canton, MI which is home to the only Ikea in Michigan! Other than that, there is really much more to Canton.
