        Here are some projects I would like to highlight from my portfolio. The first one is an Android app I created as part of a term project with 4 other people in one of my classes at Wayne State University.
        The basic idea behind the app is to have a crowd sourced list of restaurant menus so users can go to one app to look up various menus for different restaurants rather than going to each website individually.
        <br /><br />
        The second one is a lab we worked on in Grand Circus with partners. We had to make an app that acted as a car lot that stored both new and used cars.
