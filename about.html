        I am a 32 year old aspiring software engineer. I have spent the last few years working towards that goal. I started off by looking into and learning programming languages on my own.
        Then I went back to school to pursue my degree in computer science. Since then, I got accepted into a boot camp through Quicken Loans at Grand Circus.
